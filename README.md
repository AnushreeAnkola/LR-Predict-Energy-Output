# LR-Predict-Energy-Output
The environment plays a vital role in the supply of energy throughout the world. The energy output in a power plant is highly dependent on the environmental changes that occur at the location. If the energy outputs are predicted accurately, then the energy suppliers can collaborate with other sources to minimize the cost and get efficient production of energy.  In this project, we are fitting a Linear Regression formula, that can be used to predict the Energy Output at a Power Plant by comparing the relationship between various factors such as Ambient Temperature, Ambient Pressure, Vacuum, Relative Humidity. The analytics are performed on a dataset obtained from a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP). The model build gives a very accurate prediction of Energy Output for any newly supplied dataset with the same or similar dataset. Finally, a graph will be plotted which shows the closeness of the predicted energy output with the actual energy output in the dataset.
